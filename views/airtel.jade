        h3 HOW IT WORKS
        p Log onto www.kenya-airways.com
        p Make a purchase of a ticket that is less than or equal to Kshs. 140,000 inclusive of taxes
        p Once booking is through, a Booking confirmation email will be sent to your email address containing the booking reference number.
        p Use this booking reference number e.g. 7KJUE to make payment through Airtel Money using our nickname/Business Name which is 'KQPAY'
        p KQ confirms receipt of payment
        p KQ sends both SMS and email with e-ticket to customer
        p End of transaction
