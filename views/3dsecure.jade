        h3 HOW IT WORKS
        p 3D Secure payment security creates what is called a 'trust chain' throughout the transaction, shifting the liability for fraud from the merchant to the issuer under a range of conditions.
        p 3D secure payment security is only applicable to e-Commerce/Internet transactions.
          3D Secure authentication requires the cardholder to register their card to take advantage of
          this service. This is a onetime process which takes place on the card issuerâ€™s website and
          involves the cardholder answering several security questions to which only the card issuer
          and cardholder will know the answer. The cardholder selects a password and agrees on a
          secret phrase, which will be used by the card issuer during each online transaction.
